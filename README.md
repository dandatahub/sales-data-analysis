# Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable business insights.  
The goal is to apply data analysis techniques to support decision-making in a business context.

## Business Problem
Companies generate large volumes of sales data, but without proper analysis, valuable insights can be missed.  
This project aims to answer key business questions related to sales performance, revenue trends, and customer behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project represents transactional sales data, including information such as:
- Order date
- Product or category
- Quantity sold
- Revenue
- Customer or region (if available)

*A public dataset will be used for learning and demonstration purposes.*

## Key Questions
Some of the main questions explored in this analysis include:
- How do sales and revenue evolve over time?
- Which products or categories contribute most to total revenue?
- Are there seasonal patterns or trends in sales?
- Which segments (products, regions, or customers) perform best?
